Standard client-server semantics are preserved.
errors by not updating individual exit points when making modifications are prevented. (可以避免由于修改时忘记更新某个单独的退出点而导致的错误)
saves the compiler work to optimize redundant code away. (减轻了编译器的工作，无需删除冗余代码)
The strong advantage of TensorFlow is it flexibility in designing highly modular models which can also be a disadvantage for beginners since a lot of the pieces must be considered together when creating the model.
So many issues can be dealt with easily since they're usually the same issues that a lot of other people run into considering the large number of people involved in the TensorFlow community. (很多问题都可以轻松处理，因为考虑到TensorFlow社区中涉及的大量人员，这些问题通常与许多其他人遇到的问题相同。)
Developing open source projects for the sake of just developing something is not the reason behind this effort. (为了开发某些东西而开发开源项目并不是这项工作背后的原因。)
